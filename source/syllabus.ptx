      <p>“The book of the universe is written in the language of mathematics.” Galileo wrote this four hundred years ago, even before Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. The statement is as valid today as ever: We use functions in all the sciences, and calculus allows us to analyze the functions and draw scientific conclusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Calculus II is a second semester calculus course for students who have previously been introduced to the basic ideas of differential and integral calculus. Over the semester we will study three (related) topics, topics that form a central part of the language of modern science:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
            applications and methods of integration, 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            infinite series and the representation of functions by power series, and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            parametric curves in the plane.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The material we take up in this course has applications in physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, astronomy, economics, statistics, and just about everything else. We want you to leave the course not only with computational ability, but with the ability to use these notions in their natural scientific contexts, and with an appreciation of their mathematical beauty and power.

        <title>How the Credit Hours are Met by the Course</title>
        <p>
          This class meets for 3 hours and 45 minutes each week and carries the
          expectation that students will work on course learning activities
          (e.g. reading, problem sets, papers, and studying) for about 7 hours
          and 30 minutes outside of classroom per week. The syllabus includes
          more information about meeting times and expectations for student
          work.

    <title>Learning Activities</title>
    <p>
      Most weeks we will follow the same pattern of engagement with the course
      material. It alternates between instruction and assessment, and is
      designed for you to have many opportunities to practice, ask for help, and
      get feedback on every topic. 
    </p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Pre-lecture activities</title>
      <p>
        Before each lecture, you will be expected to complete a reading
        assignment. The assignment may also include watching videos and
        completing a basic quiz. The goal of these activities is to prepare you
        for lecture. Your professor will also use your responses to these
        activities to prepare for lecture.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Lecture</title>
      <p>
        Lectures will be interactive, with opportunities for you to ask
        questions and work on problems. Your professor will also use lecture to
        reinforce new concepts and provide context.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>WebAssignments</title>
      <p>
        After lecture you will continue to practice the procedures and concepts
        through a “WebAssignment”—an assignment on the WebAssign platform. You
        will have multiple opportunities to attempt these problems, and other
        problems like them. WebAssignments are due before recitation.

      <title>Recitation</title>
      <p>
        Recitation is your weekly class time with your teaching assistant.
        Recitation begins with a quiz and continues with supervised practice
        on worksheets.

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Problem sets</title>
      <p>
        Problem sets are due at the end of each week. They are designed to
        challenge you to apply the concepts into new or unique situations.
        Problem sets are also where you learn to present worked solutions
        clearly and logically.

      <title>Exams</title>
      <p>
        There will be two midterm exams and one final exam. Midterms are
        summative assessments and comprehensive of the course material taught
        until that point. The final will be cumulative. <em>Exams are designed
        to test your mastery of the course material at a deep and synthetic
        level.</em>

      <title>zyBook Participation Activities</title>
      <p>
        Reading assignments including questions graded for completion to give you the opportunity to check your understanding will be regularly assigned in our zyBook. These assignments are meant to be done <em>before</em> we cover content in lecture so that we have more time for active learning in class. <alert>You will receive full credit for a zyBook Participation Activity if you answer the questions.</alert> Because these zyBook Participation Activities are your first exposure to the material, we do not expect you to understand everything from the reading alone. <em>You will gain the most from these activities if you take them seriously, think about the questions before answering, and work to understand the reasoning for the correct answer when you get a question incorrect.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        zyBook Participation Activities are due each Tuesday morning at 8am CT. They are worth 3% of your course grade. No late zyBook Participation Activities will be accepted, but the lowest three scores will be dropped.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Discussion Participation</title>
      <p>
        Starting in the second week, the teaching assistants will take attendance in discussion. Mathematics is a human activity, and we learn by engaging with other humans. Discussion allows you to do this in a small enough group that every student can interact with peers and their TA during each meeting. Students who do not actively participate during activities in discussion may not receive credit for participation. You must attend the discussion section for which you are registered; missed discussion sections may not be made up. However, we will drop three, so discussion participation will be taken out of 10 and is 3% of your course grade.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>zyBook Challenge Activities</title>
      <p>
        Most weeks you will have a zyBook Challenge Activity. Unlike the zyBook Participation Activities, the zyBook Challenge Activities are (automatically) graded for correctness. The zyBook Challenge Activities follow up on material from lecture after you have also had time to work on the material in discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        zyBook Challenge Activities are due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. They are worth 7% of your course grade. No late zyBook Challenge Activities will be accepted, but the lowest two scores will be dropped.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Written Homework</title>
      <p>
        Most weeks you will have a written homework assignment. These will give you an opportunity to write out proofs and solutions in the manner that you will be expected to on the exams. You will submit your solutions using Gradescope following instructions provided on Canvas. The questions on each written homework will be graded for correctness by the TAs and graders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaborating with other students on the written homework is encouraged, but you must write up all reasoning and solutions on your own (in other words, no copying). Failure to abide by this guideline could be construed as a form of academic dishonesty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to understand and construct mathematical arguments or proofs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and applications (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Copilot, DALL-E, and others) for written homework does not support the learning objectives of this course and is prohibited. Using them in any way for written homework in this course is a violation of the course’s expectations and will be addressed through UW–Madison’s academic misconduct policy, specifically UWS 14.03(1)b (b) Uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each problem on written homework should be completed with neat, understandable, detailed solutions and explanations. Your explanations and proofs must be sound and rigorous, paying attention to detail and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Written homework is due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. It is worth 15% of your course grade. Late written homework will generally not be accepted. Since you likely will either experience a technical difficulty (e.g., missed the deadline, your computer shut down as you were submitting it, internet outage, etc.) or a personal emergency (being sick, attending a funeral, etc.) during the semester, the two lowest two written homework scores will be dropped. You do not need to contact your instructor or TA if such a situation does come up.

      <title>Tests and Exams</title>
      <p>
        This course will have two tests and a final exam. Each will be worth 24% of your course grade. The dates and times for these assessments are:

      </p>
      <p>
        Students must use the form provided on Canvas to inform the instructor of conflicts with the dates and times of the tests or final exam during the first two week of classes. Reports of conflicts will be reviewed. Submitting incorrect information in order to take a test or the final exam at a different time may be considered an act of academic misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        During exams, students will not be allowed to use any notes or electronic devices. Ample space will be provided on the exams for you to show your work. You must bring a writing utensil.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Added March 7, 2025</em>: If a student's overall course grade would increase by using their final exam score in place of the lower of their scores on Test I and Test II, they will receive the grade based on this alternative grade computation method.

      <p>
        Incomplete grades will be assigned only under extraordinary circumstances in accordance with L&#x26;S policy, which states as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <q>An Incomplete (I) may be reported for a student who has been enrolled in a course with a passing grade until near the end of the semester/term and then, due to illness or some other unusual and substantiated cause beyond the student’s control, has been unable to take or complete the final examination (or to complete some limited amount of term work). An Incomplete is not given to a student who stays away from a final examination unless the student proves to the instructor that he or she was prevented from attending as indicated above. In the absence of such proof the grade reported will be an F. Even when a student can provide verifiable documentation, a student may still earn a grade of F if his/her work convinces the instructor that the student cannot successfully pass the course.</q>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you feel an incomplete grade may be warranted, you must contact me <em>before</em> the end of the final examination period on Friday, May 9, 2025.

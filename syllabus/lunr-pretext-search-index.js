  "body": " MATH-UA 122 Calculus II  Departmental Syllabus, Fall 2025 term     Matthew Leingang Department of Mathematics New York University  Last Updated:        Calculus II is a coordinated course. This syllabus contains information shared across all lecture sections. Your professors will also provide a syllabus supplement that contains information specific to your lecture section.    Course Information     Course Description  Techniques of integration. Further applications. Plane analytic geometry. Polar coordinates and parametric equations. Infinite series, including power series.    Credits  4    Prerequisites  MATH-UA 121 Calculus I, or exam credit, or placement test. Visit the departmental course page for more detail.    Instructional modality  Section 001 is online. All other sections are in-person.     “The book of the universe is written in the language of mathematics.” Galileo wrote this four hundred years ago, even before Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. The statement is as valid today as ever: We use functions in all the sciences, and calculus allows us to analyze the functions and draw scientific conclusions.  Calculus II is a second semester calculus course for students who have previously been introduced to the basic ideas of differential and integral calculus. Over the semester we will study three (related) topics, topics that form a central part of the language of modern science:   applications and methods of integration,    infinite series and the representation of functions by power series, and    parametric curves in the plane.     The material we take up in this course has applications in physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, astronomy, economics, statistics, and just about everything else. We want you to leave the course not only with computational ability, but with the ability to use these notions in their natural scientific contexts, and with an appreciation of their mathematical beauty and power.   Learning Outcomes     Antidifferentiate elementary functions and evaluate definite integrals    Analyze sequence and series    Use calculus to analyze plane curves       Meeting Pattern  Lecture sections meet twice weekly for 75 minutes, led by a professor. Recitation sections meets once weekly for 75 minutes, led by a teaching assistant. The times and locations of your sections are visible on Albert .    How the Credit Hours are Met by the Course  This class meets for 3 hours and 45 minutes each week and carries the expectation that students will work on course learning activities (e.g. reading, problem sets, papers, and studying) for about 7 hours and 30 minutes outside of classroom per week. The syllabus includes more information about meeting times and expectations for student work.     Learning Activities  Most weeks we will follow the same pattern of engagement with the course material. It alternates between instruction and assessment, and is designed for you to have many opportunities to practice, ask for help, and get feedback on every topic.   Pre-lecture activities  Before each lecture, you will be expected to complete a reading assignment. The assignment may also include watching videos and completing a basic quiz. The goal of these activities is to prepare you for lecture. Your professor will also use your responses to these activities to prepare for lecture.    Lecture  Lectures will be interactive, with opportunities for you to ask questions and work on problems. Your professor will also use lecture to reinforce new concepts and provide context.    WebAssignments  After lecture you will continue to practice the procedures and concepts through a “WebAssignment”—an assignment on the WebAssign platform. You will have multiple opportunities to attempt these problems, and other problems like them. WebAssignments are due before recitation.    Recitation  Recitation is your weekly class time with your teaching assistant. Recitation begins with a quiz and continues with supervised practice on worksheets.    Problem sets  Problem sets are due at the end of each week. They are designed to challenge you to apply the concepts into new or unique situations. Problem sets are also where you learn to present worked solutions clearly and logically.    Exams  There will be two midterm exams and one final exam. Midterms are summative assessments and comprehensive of the course material taught until that point. The final will be cumulative. Exams are designed to test your mastery of the course material at a deep and synthetic level.      Textbook and Other Required Materials     Textbook  The course will closely follow the textbook Essential Calculus, Early Transcendentals , by James Stewart. An electronic version of the text is included in WebAssign.    WebAssign  The course also requires a subscription to Cengage WebAssign in order to do assigned textbook problems. You can buy your subscription automatically through Folett ACCESS , independently through the NYU Bookstore , or within WebAssign itself. For most students, the lowest price will be found through ACCESS. This is the only purchase required to participate in the course.    Brightspace  Each lecturer will have their own Brightspace site, through which they will distribute lecture and study materials. Brightspace is your course hub which links to each of the other platforms used.    Gradescope  You will scan and submit your written homework to Gradescope . Homework will be graded and returned to you within Gradescope. Quizzes and exams will be taken on paper, but the instructional team will scan them and upload them to Gradescope. Graded quizzes and midterms will be returned to you using Gradescope.    Discussion boards  Lecture sections may use Ed Discussions , Campuswire , or the Brightspace Discussions tool to organize questions and discussion outside of class.    PollEverywhere  Lecturers may use PollEverywhere or other polling software to facilitate in-class discussion.       Grading  Most of the grade components are identified above. Participation will be measured through attendance and completion of in-class activities. The exact rubric may vary across lecture sections.  The lowest five (5) problem set scores and the lowest five (5) quiz scores will be dropped before averaging. This is to account for any unforeseen circumstances which prevent you from attending recitation or completing an assignment to the best of your ability. There will be no other extensions or makeups on quizzes or problem sets .  The grade components are averaged into a final calculated grade using the following weights:    Component  Weight    Problem sets  10%    Quizzes  15%    WebAssignments  5%    Midterm I  20%    Midterm II  20%    Final exam  25%    Participation  5%    Grades will be calculated to two decimal places. They will not be rounded up to the next whole number. The lower cutoff for each letter grade is given in the table below.     Letter Grade  Lower Cutoff    A  93%    A-  90%    B+  87%    B  83%    B-  80%    C+  75%    C  65%    D  50%    F  0%    It is possible that these cutoffs will be adjusted at the end of the semester, but only in the downward direction in order to raise letter grades slightly. There is no school- or departmentally-prescribed distribution of letter grades. Letter grades across sections will be comparable.    Institutional Syllabus Statements  The following statements from the institution all apply in this course:   Academic Calendar & Religious Observances    Academic Integrity    Statement Accommodations for Students with Disabilities    Course Evaluations    Diversity & Inclusion Statement    Mental Health and Well-Being Statement    Privacy of Student Records & the Use of Audio Recorded Lectures Statement    Students Rules, Rights & Responsibilities, and    Teaching & Learning Data Transparency Statement   The full text of all of these statements can be found in the Guide .
